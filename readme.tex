{\Large README}

To build the complete document, open the \texttt{main.tex} file and compile.

Individual chapters can also be compiled to avoid long build time. To do this open the chapter file, see the \texttt{chapter} folder, and compile. Note that numbering, like chapter numbering, and references will usually be wrong when compiling just a chapter.
