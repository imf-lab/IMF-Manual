\chapter{The IMF Language Implemented}
\label{ch:The IMF Language Formalized}

The IMF language is implemented using semantic web technologies. These artefacts are published at \url{http://ns.imfid.org}.

The IMF Ontology is defined by a Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology, also called the IMF Ontology.
The ontology includes all the terms of the IMF language described with different metadata, including a textual definition, and their formal semantics which details how a term is related to other terms in the language. 
%
The grammar of the IMF language is specified by a set of SHACL shape specifications. They describe the required and permissible ways terms in the IMF Ontology may be used.
%

%The normative description of the IMF language is found in the OWL ontology and the SHACL shapes published at \url{http://ns.imfid.org}. 

%An informative extract from these artefacts is given in \autoref{ch:imf-ontology}. The formalisation of IMF types are presented in \autoref{ch:types}.
