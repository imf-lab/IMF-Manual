\chapter{A New Way of Working using Information Models}
\label{ch:Chapter 3}




\section{Problem Statement}
\label{ch:Section 1.1}
Facility assets in the energy industry are becoming increasingly complex.
There is a need for better communication between organisations, people, and IT systems. Actors in the industry use
different methods, tools, and work processes to develop a facility asset. This misalignment is seen:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Along with the Capital Value Process (CVP);
  \item Along the supply chain; and
  \item Between disciplines and systems within the same facility asset.
\end{itemize}
The consequences of this are loss of information, risk of safety and quality breaches, duplication of work,
a lot of manual mapping, reduced possibilities for re-use of concepts and design, lock-in to a portfolio of
applications, and a lot of company-specific requirements that are tuned to fulfil needs for a certain portfolio of
applications.

\autoref{fig:Figure 1} illustrates the problem of today's way of working. The figure shows the \emph{logical} flow of value
creation during an industrial investment and development project, the actual execution schedule will have
many overlaps and iterations that are intentionally left out.

\end{figure}


When a facility asset is developed today, the work begins by defining the overall requirements and functionality
(DG0). The result is typically contained in a few documents, which means that at this stage a holistic description is
feasible~\ding{182}. As the work progresses into the design phase of the facility asset, more specialised discipline
expertise is necessary (DG1 and DG2). Since the way of working is document-based, the result is an increasing number
of documents. This leads to a fragmentation of information spread across documents, due to the inherent features of
their format. Because of this fragmentation, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain a holistic description of the
facility asset. The result is extensive interface coordination between discipline experts~\ding{183}.

When the investment decision is made to execute the construction of the facility asset (DG3)~\ding{184}, the number of
documents produced grows exponentially as the supply chain involving both contractors, suppliers, and manufacturers
ramp up their deliveries for construction, installation, and commissioning of the facility asset~\ding{185}. At this
stage, and likely to have started earlier in the CVP, a lot of information in documents is duplicated, resulting in
several sources of the same information. The consequence of this is labour-intensive work to
    prevent quality deviations and HSE incidents.

When the operation (DG4) and handover to the operator takes place~\ding{186}, information is fragmented and lacks
relational information. This often results in a need to ``re-engineer'' the solution to establish the holistic view
necessary to maintain, control and evolve the facility asset~\ding{187}.

It is worth noting that reduced information quality can reduce the decision quality and is often costly and
inefficient to manage.

\section{Requirements to  Solution}
\label{ch:Section 1.2}
The objective of the Information Modelling Framework (IMF) is to enable
a transition from the current documentation practice discussed in \autoref{ch:Section 1.1}, to the use of information
  models as a way of capturing and expressing information about facility assets.

To achieve this transition, the solution  must facilitate for:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Incremental implementation. Thus, handle both a new information model practice and the transition towards it,
        yet not require existing applications and tools to be replaced.
  \item Scalability across disciplines, work processes, and the value chain. The method needs to be granular enough to
        support any level of complexity and detail, depending on the need and where in the process the SMEs are.
  \item Ease of use. Be made intuitive to the extent that the SMEs themselves are users of the framework. Thus, the
        method must support and allow existing discipline design workflows.
  \item Utilisation and promotion of shared libraries and existing standards.
  \item Open protocols for exchange of facility asset information and provide a format which enables automated
        verification and augmented engineering extensions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Using Information Models}
\label{sec:userinformationmodel}
To solve the problems discussed in \autoref{ch:Section 1.1}, fundamental
changes in the way we capture and represent information are needed. Used properly, information models in
combination with reference data libraries (RDLs) include the features necessary to handle the problems of the current
document practice.

\autoref{fig:Figure 10} illustrates a new way of working using information models through the logical flow of value
creation during an industrial investment and development project. The actual execution schedule will have many
overlaps and iterations that are intentionally left out.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/IMFmanual-img010.jpg}
  \caption{Using information models instead of documents during an
    industrial investment and development project.}
  \label{fig:Figure 10}
\end{figure}

The overall requirements to functionality of the facility asset (DG0) are captured in an information model~\ding{182}.
As the work progresses into the design phase of the facility asset, several more detailed information models are
created by discipline expertise to mature the design (DG1 and DG2)~\ding{183}. Due to the inherent features of the
(machine-readable) format, the information models can be continuously checked for design flaws by an automated work process. Furthermore, the fragments of information, now represented through several
information models, can be integrated along the way to ensure a consistent design and a valid description of the
facility asset on a holistic level.

When the investment decision is made to execute the construction of the facility asset (DG3)~\ding{184}, information
models describing parts of the facility asset are produced in large quantities by the supply chain.

When approaching operation (DG4) and handover to operator takes place~\ding{185}, the resulting information model, can
be thought of as a \emph{model-of-models}, containing the historical context and all design decisions made all the way back to DG0~\ding{186}.
The holistic description and the contents of the facility asset is available at any granular level as required to operate, control, maintain, and later do modifications on the facility asset~\ding{187}. Furthermore, access to
information is not restricted by documents and formatting but can be navigated freely~\ding{188} and maintained efficiently.

\section{New Methods, Roles, and Competencies}
\label{sec:newmethodsroles}
The new way of working implies new roles and requires new
competencies. The following roles are relevant:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The \emph{subject matter expert} (SME). SMEs are experts on discipline engineering. For example, a process
        engineer who develops the design of the main processing system, or an electrical engineer who develops the design of
        the electrical supply and distribution.
  \item The \emph{system engineer} is an expert on system integration. For example, a system engineer is responsible
        for coherent integration of system designs from, e.g., different disciplines, different phases of the project
        lifecycle and different parties in the value chain.
  \item The \emph{data engineer} is an expert on the flow of data between IT systems and applications. For example, a
        data engineer manages the export of data from a model authoring application into an engineering register system.
  \item The \emph{knowledge engineer} is an expert on knowledge representation and semantic technology. For example, a knowledge engineer manages
        the validation and integrity verification of the model of a design.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htb]

  \caption{Different expertise and how they enable information modelling of facility assets.}
  \label{fig:Figure 11}
\end{figure}

Engineering and design is a process of making a series of decisions founded on subject matter expertise and governed
by requirements and limitations. This is the domain of SMEs and system engineers, but the new way of working allows a
significant shift in focus away from \emph{formatting} of information, and towards \emph{creating} information.
It is less constrained by document formats and instead allows a much more flexible and incremental way of creating a
design. This will have an impact on how the work is optimally allocated into different roles.

The SME role is by definition to hold expertise on a defined subject, usually a single discipline, but the new way of
working will reward an approach of also working across disciplines that are interlinked and interdependent, thus
reducing time-consuming coordination effort. As systems thinking is a fundamental part, the system engineer role may
have a stronger impact, in particular when integrating segments of models into a whole, and when managing how systems
interact.

While the data engineer has conventionally had more focus on batch transfer of data between systems, this role will
need to strengthen the focus on publishing and sharing of model data, and on leveraging semantic technologies. A
significant value of modelling is that it allows use of advanced semantic technologies and mechanisms for
machine-based validation and verification. The role of the knowledge engineer is instrumental for achieving this.

\autoref{fig:Figure 11} illustrates how the different roles work together to enable modelling of parts of the facility asset that
then are integrated into a complete model where semantic technology is utilised to verify and validate the integrity
of the model.


SMEs model information that today is available only in fragments, commonly recorded in documents~\ding{182}.  The documents
may refer to standards, possibly exploiting reference data, such as names of shared properties and classes, and
initiatives to digitally enrich documentation format such as DEXPI\footnote{\url{https://dexpi.org/specifications/}}
\ding{183}.  When modelling, the SME creates the building blocks of the model from definitions held in a common
industry library, a reference data library~\ding{184}, enabling the re-use of well-proven design patterns (e.g., type
of pump configuration). The building blocks are put together into a model in accordance with the rules and
structures of IMF that build on the IEC/ISO81346 O\&G standard~\cite{81346-OG}~\ding{185}.

IMF does not require modelling to be done in one single model, something which often is implied when referring to data-centric
or model-centric ways of working. Instead, the modelling can be distributed across many smaller IMF models, here shown as puzzle
pieces, that the system engineer later can bring together as a complete puzzle~\ding{186}. IMF models can be
translated~\ding{187} into semantically enriched models that enable the knowledge engineers to exploit verification techniques such as automated
reasoning~\ding{188}.
