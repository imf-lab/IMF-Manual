This specification provides a visual profile for graphical
representations of Information Modelling Framework (IMF) information
models. The profile is based on visualising models as graphs of nodes and edges, and 
defines a set of guidelines for the shapes, arrows or
edges, groups and colours to use when IMF information
models are represented visually.
