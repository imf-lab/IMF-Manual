\chapter{Way Forward}
The following topics in the scope of IMF are not fully covered in this version, but are
identified as future work:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Detailing a concept of type to apply to complex and composite structures such as packages and design codes, and
        the integration of such models into larger model structures.
  \item Concepts for Management of Change.
  \item Concepts for ID management.
  \item Concepts for specifying mappings from an IMF model to engineering registers.
  \item Concepts for specifying relationships between descriptors, i.e., between engineering numbering and reference
        designations.
  \item Templates mechanism for translating IMF models to ontology allowing for semantic verification.
  \item Mechanisms for using RDL resources.
  \item Specification for software integration implementation of IMF.
  \item Semantic verification, integrity checking and interpretation of IMF models by means of the Industrial Data Ontology.
\end{itemize}
