\chapter{A Note on Versioning}

The Information Modelling Framework (IMF) is and has been in development since the early 2020's. During this time the IMF Manual, of which this document is a version of, has been released in incremental versions. These versions have followed a loose versioning scheme. 

We wish now to follow the semantic versioning scheme (\url{https://semver.org/}) and
indicate that IMF is in rapid development by using semantic versioning's major version 0, e.g., \texttt{0.y.z}. This and all previous versions should therefore be considered as minor version of major version 0. Hence, older versions that do not have major version 0, should be prefixed with major version 0, e.g., the IMF Manual released 2023-07-05 has the semantic version 0.2.1.

We anticipate that version 1.0.0 will be released in the fall of 2024.
